Anchor is a small app using compass/magnetometer and GPS to mark your current position (make an anchor) so you can find your direction back. 

This is an app for Sailfish / SailfishX / Jolla phone.

It will use the magnetometer as a fallback for compass. This is useful for Sony Xperia X until the compass is fixed in SailfishX.

It is also a learning experience (experiment) for me... :)
